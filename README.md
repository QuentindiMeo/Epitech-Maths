<i><b>Disclaimer:</b></i> I am strongly against cheating and copying others' work. If you are yourself a student of Epitech or looking forward to cheat using my work, just <b>don't</b>. More than lying to the system, you're lying to yourself. Do the projects, they really aren't that hard. I won't take responsibility for any <i>-42</i> grade of yours.
